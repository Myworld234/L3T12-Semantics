Differences between sm and md models in example.py file:

I noticed that with the sm model I got a warning: 'UserWarning: [W007] The model you're using has no word vectors loaded'
With the md model there is no warning about vectors, which means the md model and sm model could have different purposes. 
Such as: the md model could be used for a out of the box solution and the sm model can be trained with word vectors for 
more of a concise result of similarities.
