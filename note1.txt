What I found interest about the Similarities between: Cat, Banana and Monkey:

Similarity between Cat and Banana is interesting since there seems to be similarities as
the result is a 0.22 similarity. Even though its low, its interesting that they even have 
score of similarity.

Cat and Monkey is also interest but obvious as the score of 0.59 similarly makes sense 
since both entities fall under the category of animals.


My own example:

I would like to compare the similarities between Lion, Elephant and potatoes.

Results:
Lion Lion 1.0
Lion Elephant 0.6265946626663208
Lion Potatoes -0.03420473635196686
Elephant Lion 0.6265946626663208
Elephant Elephant 1.0
Elephant Potatoes 0.0016501322388648987
Potatoes Lion -0.03420473635196686
Potatoes Elephant 0.0016501322388648987

I found the similarity between Lion and Elephant interesting due to the fact that
the score was higher than cat monkey, even though they both comparing animals, Lion
and Elephant part of the Big 5 which push the similarity score higher.

Lion and Potatoes was also interesting since the one is plural(Potatoes) and the other 
singular(Lion). Causing their similarity to be drastically impacted! When change the 
word potatoes to singular(potato), we see the score changing to 0.29.
